# Tabletop-Exercise-for-Hospital
**INTRODUCTION**

This tabletop exercise includes discussion points to guide healthcare leaders on how to prepare for and execute a cyber security emergency plan in a pediatric hospital setting, tailored for HIPAA compliance. According to the recent Health-ISAC Annual Health Sector Cyber Threat Landscape Report, Ransomware, Phishing Attacks, and Compromised Credentials were the top threats facing healthcare organizations in 2024. As reported by healthcare professionals, the direct impact to healthcare delivery included the disruption of normal operation of diagnostic technology, loss of electronic medical records resulting in delays and disruption to patient care, and exposure of patients' personal health information (PHI). 

I have become very curious about cybersecurity incidents affecting the Healthcare industry as a result of several high-profile stories highlighting the increased rates of cybersecurity attacks across the country. In response to this trend, Children's National Medical Hospital located in Washington, D.C. which logs close to 650,000 outpatient visits annually, has implemented an emergency response program known as "Code Dark" aka system-wide "off" switch, to minimize the impact of a broad-based cyber attack. It signals to the staff to immediately shut down or unplug internet-connected devices to prevent further spread of the attack.

This tabletop exercise will simulate a ransomware attack on the Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. We have seen many real-life examples of these in the news including the most notable one in May 2024 against Ascension in which 140 hospitals across 10 states were affected. 

**GOALS AND OBJECTIVES**

1. **Enhance Awareness**: Educate employees on potential cybersecurity threats and their potential impact on hospital operations, patient safety and regulatory compliance (HIPPA)

2. **Clarify Roles and Responsibilities**: Define and reinforce what is expected of each department during a cybersecurity incident. 

3. **Improve Communication**: Identify effective communication channels and protocols among relevant stakeholders during a crisis. 

4. **Validate Existing Plans**: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current incident response plan, policies, and procedures related to a cybersecurity breach.

5. **Identify Gaps**: Uncover gaps in training, resources, or processes that could hinder an effective response to the cyber incident. 

6. **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage interdepartmental collaboration and information sharing during a simulated crisis. 

7. **Address Pediatric-Specific Concerns**: Consider the unique ethical and practical challenges associated with a cyber incident affecting a hospital that treats minors, such as parental 
   notification and the potential for increased vulnerability. 

8. **Focus on HIPPA Compliance**: Creating a culture within the organization that adheres to the HIPPA requirements related to data breach notification, patient privacy, and security safeguards in 
   the context of a cybersecurity breach.
   
  **SCENARIO OVERVIEW: RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) SYSTEM**
  This will be a simulated ransomware attack that has encrypted a significant portion of the hospital's EHR system. The following elements will be incorporated into the scenario:

  **Initial Intrusion**: Discovery of unusual network activity and the subsequent identification of encrypted files within the EHR system. A SIEM tool such as Splunk would be used by a large 
  organization to help detect malicious activity and monitor security events through the use of data analytics and automation. 

  **Impact on Operations**: The inability of health providers to access patient records would be highly disruptive to hospital functions such as admissions, scheduling appointments, medication
  administration, and accessing lab/imaging results. There have been examples across the country where desperately needed cancer treatment was delayed due to ransomware attacks on health 
  facilities. 

  **Data Exfiltration**: Patients will be informed of of credible threat to personal data such as names, date of birth, medical history, social security numbers, and insurance information. 

  **Partial Communication and Power Blackout**: Partial disruption of internal communication systems requiring staff to  use alternative methods of communication such as satellite phones or 
    walkie-talkies. All hospitals should have backup generators and set protocols to handle power emergencies. 

  **Media Inquiry**: How one handles the media is just as important as how the cybersecurity incident is handled to prevent brand damage and negative publicity during a crisis. Participants in the   tabletop exercise will discuss potential media inquiries that could arise and how to address them, including an overall public communication strategy. 

  **TARGET AUDIENCE**: 
   Representatives from the following key departments will be required: Information Technology (IT), Nursing Administration, Medical Staff (Physicians), Hospital Administration, Risk Management
   and Compliance, Legal Counsel, Public Relations/Communications, Patient Advocacy, and Security Personnel. 

   **EXERCISE STRUCTURE AND FACILITATION**: 

   1. **Introduction and Objectives (15 minutes)**: The facilitator will provide an overview of the exercise goals, objectives, scenario, and participant roles.
   2. **Scenario Presentations (15 minutes)**: A detailed scenario will be presented to participants.
   3. **Guided Discussion (60-90 minutes)**: The goal of this conversation is to guide participants through a series of questions to elicit discussion and decision-making related to the unfolding
      scenario. The prompts will focus on the following areas:

      **Initial Response and Identification**: What are the immediate steps upon discovering the ransomware attack? Who needs to be notified? How do we verify the extent of the attack?
      **Containment and Eradication**: What measures need to be taken to contain the attack and prevent further spread throughout the hospital? What are the protocols for isolating affected 
      systems?
      **Data Breach Assessment (HIPPA Focus)**: How do we determine if a data breach has occurred according to HIPPA guidelines? What information needs to be gathered to assess patient data risk?
      **Notification Procedures (HIPPA Focus)**: What are the notification requirements under HIPPA? Who needs to be notified? What information must be included? How to handle parental 
      notification for pediatric patients?
      **Communication Strategies**: How will internal and external communication be handled? What information should be shared with staff, patients, and the public? How will misinformation and/or
      rumors be addressed?
      **Business Continuity and Recovery**: What are the contingency plans for maintaining essential hospital operations during EHR downtime? How will patient care continue? What are the steps
      for data recovery?
      **Legal and Regulatory Considerations**: What are the implications of the incident under HIPAA? What documentation is required? For example, HIPAA requires healthcare organizations to report 
      security incidents to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and in the case of a large-scale breach affecting 500 or more individuals, the breach must be reported within 60 days of discovery.
      **Impact on Patient Safety**: How does one ensure patient safety during the system outage? What manual processes can be manually implemented?
      **Post-Incident Analysis**: What steps will be taken after the incident to analyze the response, identify lessons learned, and improve future preparedness?
      **Wrap-up and Debriefing (30 minutes)**: The facilitator will lead a debriefing session to discuss takeaways, identify areas for improvement, and reinforce cyber security best practices. 
       During this session, participants are invited to share their insights and observations.

      **EXAMPLES OF DISCUSSION QUESTIONS**:

      1. Upon initial notification of the ransomware attack, who is the first point of contact within your department?
      2. Walk us through the process your department would follow to maintain critical functions if the EHR system is unavailable.
      3. How would you communicate the situation to parents and guardians of minor patients who might be calling the hospital with increased anxiety and questions regarding the health and
         safety of their child after hearing about the incident on the news?
      4. What are key considerations for drafting a notification letter to parents and guardians in compliance with HIPAA?
      5. What internal communication channels would be used if primary email systems were compromised?
      6. What are the specific challenges you foresee in restoring pediatric patient data?
      7. How would you address media inquiries while protecting the patient privacy of minors and the integrity of the investigation?
      8. Describe the process to ensure continued safe and effective delivery of healthcare specifically for medication administration, allergy checks, and access to patient history for a child 
         with a complex medical background. Participants should be encouraged to think practically about how essential clinical functions would be maintained without relying on electronic systems, 
         in particular for vulnerable pediatric patients. 
      9. What decision would the leadership team need to consider if detailed medical histories of pediatric patients were under threat of being released and exposed to the public? What are the 
         legal and ethical implications that would weigh most heavily in this discussion.
      

      **DELIVERABLES**: Following the tabletop exercise, a comprehensive report is generated to summarize key discussion points and observations; identify strengths and weaknesses in the security 
        program; close gaps in policies, procedures, and training; recommend actions for improvement to include resource allocation, enhanced training programs, and updates to the incident 
        response plan.
